# Maggie McDonald Portfolio

Hello, and thanks for checking out my personal portfolio!
<br>

I am from Santa Barbara, California and have always been a So-Cal girl, although my desire to travel always keeps me moving and exploring new places around the world. I love to be outdoors or in nature when I can, and enjoy doing athletic activities outside. Some of these activities include hiking, biking, running, climbing, volleyball, and more! Besides being outside, I have always had a creative side that includes many hobbies as well. Some of these hobbies that I enjoy are drawing, painting, photography, designing, graphic design / art, pottery, playing guitar, and making music. I actually self-taught myself how to play the guitar and ukulele during the Covid Pandemic and recently got a new electric guitar that I am excited to learn how to play better! Lastly, and most importantly, I am a big time cat lover and have a little Siamese kitty named Mishka. She is the best cat ever :)
<br>

I am also a full-stack software developer with a passion for React, Redux, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS and Ruby on Rails.
Whether it is design, graphic art, photography, making music or programming a new application, I have always enjoyed exploring and growing my creative side. I love learning about new technologies and challenging myself to think
logically, methodically, and creatively. When building an idea, a userâ€™s experience is very important to me, so I strive
to craft an interface that is innovative, visually appealing, and intuitive for everyone.
<br>

Currently, I am learning TypeScript, React Native, and Figma. I strive to find time to learn more!
